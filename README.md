##The microcontroller button counter simulation provides an interactive way to understand embedded systems concepts without physical hardware. The simulation features a realistic push button with debounce protection, an LCD display that updates with each valid press, and a professional circuit diagram showing the connections between components.

The application includes educational elements like Arduino code samples and explanations of key concepts such as button debouncing. The serial monitor shows real-time system events, mimicking how developers debug embedded systems through serial communication.

This web-based approach allows users to learn about microcontroller programming and electronic circuit design in an accessible format, with visual feedback that reinforces the core concepts of input handling, debouncing, and output display in embedded systems.##
